abstract = {研究室内での文献管理において重要となるのは「メンバ間で文献情報の共有を行えること」そして「容易に文献を検索して，論文に引用できること」である．現在，文献管理ツールが多数開発されているが上記の条件を十分満たすものはない．そこで，本研究では研究室内での利用に特化した文献管理システム「bole」を開発する．提案システムは，研究室内で文献情報の共有を行いやすくするため，ウェブアプリケーションによる実装を行い，文献情報を登録する際，同時に文献に関する研究分野やコメント，評価などの情報を追加登録する．また，筆者らの研究室では，論文執筆の際，参考文献の記述にBibTEXを利用するので，便利にBibTEXを利用するために，文献を論文に引用するときに必要な「引用キー」を1クリックでコピーできる機能などの実装を行う．提案システムの導入により，研究室内での文献情報の共有を簡単にすることができ，さらに論文執筆の効率化を進めるという提案システムの有用性を検証する．The important things about managing literatures in laboratories are "Sharing literatures between members" and "Easy to search literatures and to cite them in papers". Currently, many literature management tools have developed, but not enough to satisfy the above conditions. In this paper, we develop the literature management system "bole" that specializes in the use of laboratories. The proposed system is developed as the web application, and when literature information is registered in the system, research area, comment, evaluation, and so on about literatures are registered as additional information in order to facilitate sharing of literature information in laboratories. BibTEX is used in our laboratory to write a paper, therefore we develop functions convenient to use BibTEX, for example citation key can be copied with one click. We show the utility of the proposed system to share literature information easily in the laboratory, and efficiently to write the papers.},

@article{Hartmann1996,
abstract = {Simulation techniques, especially those implemented on a computer, are frequently employed in natural as well as in social sciences with considerable success. There is mounting evidence that the "model-building era" (J. Niehans) that dominated the theoretical activities of the sciences for a long time is about to be succeeded or at least lastingly supplemented by the "simulation era". But what exactly are models? What is a simulation and what is the difference and the relation between a model and a simulation? These are some of the questions addressed in this article. I maintain that the most significant feature of a simulation is that it allows scientists to imitate one process by another process. "Process" here refers solely to a temporal sequence of states of a system. Given the observation that processes are dealt with by all sorts of scientists, it is apparent that simulations prove to be a powerful interdisciplinarily acknowledged tool. Accordingly, simulations are best suited to investigate the various research strategies in different sciences more carefully. To this end, I focus on the function of simulations in the research process. Finally, a somewhat detailed case-study from nuclear physics is presented which, in my view, illustrates elements of a typical simulation in physics.},
